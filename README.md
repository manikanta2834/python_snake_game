# 🐍 Python Snake Game - IO Edition

Welcome to the **Python Snake Game - IO Edition**, a modern, high-performance web-based arcade game inspired by the legendary *Slither.io*. Experience the classic snake mechanics reimagined with smooth vector physics, a massive open world, and intelligent AI opponents.

## 🎮 How to Play

Dive into the arena and grow your snake to become the longest survivor!

- **Movement**: The snake follows your **Mouse Cursor**. Move your mouse to steer smoothly in any direction (360° freedom).
- **Boost**: Click and hold the **Left Mouse Button** or **Spacebar** to sprint. Use this to cut off enemies or escape danger!
- **Objective**: 
    - Eat the **Glowing Orbs** scattered across the map to grow longer and increase your score.
    - **Avoid Collisions**: Do not crash your head into other snakes!
    - **Defeat Enemies**: Cut off other snakes to make them crash into your body. When they die, they drop mass that you can eat for a massive score boost.

## 🚀 Features

- **Smooth IO Physics**: Abandoning the rigid grid for fluid, vector-based movement.
- **Smart AI Bots**: Compete against autonomous snakes that roam the map, hunt for food, and try to trap you.
- **Dynamic Camera**: A viewport system that tracks your snake as you explore the infinite-feeling world.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Designed with a sleek **Glassmorphism** aesthetic, neon glow effects, and responsive overlays.
- **High Scores**: Your best runs are saved to a database, challenging you to beat your personal best.
